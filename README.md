# Small Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Overview

This project aims to classify small images into 10 categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The CIFAR-10 dataset is used for training and evaluating the model. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset is included in the Keras library. It contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each with a 32x32 pixel resolution and three color channels (RGB).

## Requirements

To run this project, you need:

- Google Colab
- Required libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, numpy, matplotlib

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Small_Image_Classification_CNN.ipynb`.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset, define and train the CNN model, and evaluate its performance.
3. Experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and training strategies to improve classification accuracy.

## Results

Provide details of the model's performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on the test set.
